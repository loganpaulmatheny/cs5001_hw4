    Import this data into your code. Do NOT copy/paste it.
    Our automated tests may substitute an updated version of this file with
    MORE data than you see here. Your code should be able to handle an
    arbitrary number of nested lists (representing T-Lines). For example, we
    reserve the right to add the Green, Blue and Silver lines, OR remove the
    Red line from our test data. Ensure your code is robust enough to handle
    any such modifications.
